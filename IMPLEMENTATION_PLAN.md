# üèà BoxCall Implementation Plan

> **Based on existing confidence.js, practiceMode.js, filterManager.js, and CSV template**  
> **Goal**: Transform concept code into production-ready BoxCall platform

---

## üéØ **PHASE 1: Core Playbook System (2-3 weeks)**

### **Step 1: CSV Import & Data Structure**
Based on `Playbook_Template_bc.csv`, implement:

```javascript
// Expected CSV structure:
{
  Formation: "River|Doubles|Purple|Trio",
  FDir: "R|L", 
  Play: "Squid|Trail|IZ|Truck|ALPHA|CHARLIE|ECHO|GOLF",
  pType: "Pass|Run|RPO",
  prefDown: "1|2|3",
  prefDis: "Short|Medium|Long", 
  prefHash: "L|M|R",
  prefCov: "Zone|Man",
  Personnel: "Reg|Heavy|Light",
  keyPlayer1: "Alex|Lucas|Jayce|Diego",
  // ... additional columns
}
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create CSV upload component in `/src/pages/playbook/`
- [ ] Build CSV parser similar to existing `csvParser.js`
- [ ] Validate required columns (Formation, Play, pType, etc.)
- [ ] Store parsed data in Supabase with team association
- [ ] Error handling for malformed CSV files

### **Step 2: Filter System Implementation**
Port existing `filterManager.js` functionality:

```javascript
// Core filtering logic already exists in attachment
- Dynamic filter addition/removal
- Multi-value filter support (Arrays)
- Real-time filter updates
- Filter persistence in state
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Integrate `addFilterCategory()` and `removeFilterCategory()`
- [ ] Build filter UI components using existing BaseButton/FormSelect
- [ ] Implement `extractFilterOptions()` for dynamic filter values
- [ ] Connect filters to play display with live updates

### **Step 3: Confidence System Integration**
Port existing `confidence.js` algorithm:

```javascript
// Already implemented confidence scoring:
- getPlayConfidence(play, filters) // Returns 0-100 score
- getMatchReasons(play, filters)    // Explains why play matches
- getConfidenceColor(score)         // Green/Orange/Red indicators
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Import confidence functions into playbook page
- [ ] Display confidence scores with color coding
- [ ] Show match reasons in play cards
- [ ] Add confidence-based sorting (high to low)

---

## üéØ **PHASE 2: Practice Mode & Scripts (2-3 weeks)**

### **Step 4: Practice Script Generation**
Port existing `practiceMode.js` functionality:

```javascript
// Already implemented practice system:
- togglePracticeMode(active)
- createPracticeScript(metadata)
- addPlay(scriptId, play)
- Practice script management (CRUD operations)
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Integrate practice mode toggle in playbook interface
- [ ] Build practice script creation form
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop play addition to scripts
- [ ] Export practice scripts to PDF/print format
- [ ] Save/load practice scripts from database

### **Step 5: Practice UI System**
Port existing `practiceUI.js` components:

```javascript
// Script management UI already designed:
- renderPracticeScripts()
- ScriptForm component
- ScriptCard component
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create practice mode panel in sidebar
- [ ] Build script cards with play lists
- [ ] Implement script editing and deletion
- [ ] Add practice timing and organization tools

## üéØ **PHASE 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)**

### **Step 6: Game Mode Implementation**
The `gameMode.js` file is empty - design needed:

```javascript

```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Design game interface (mobile-first for sideline use)
- [ ] Implement play calling workflow
- [ ] Add game state management (score, time, field position)

### **Step 7: Enhanced Analytics**
Build on confidence system for deeper insights:

```javascript
// Analytics to implement:
- Play success tracking over time
- Formation effectiveness analysis
- Situational play success rates
- Performance trend visualization
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Track play outcomes (success/failure)
- [ ] Build analytics dashboard
- [ ] Generate reports for coaches
- [ ] Identify play tendencies and patterns

### **Step 9: Role-Based Access Control**

```javascript
// User roles to implement:
HEAD_COACH: {
  permissions: ['FULL_ACCESS', 'TEAM_SETTINGS', 'BILLING']
},
ASSISTANT_COACH: {
  permissions: ['PLAYBOOK_EDIT', 'PRACTICE_SCRIPTS', 'ANALYTICS_VIEW']
