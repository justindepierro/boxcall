```

## 🎯 **Understanding Your BoxCall Database**

### **What Each Table Does:**
- **`teams`** 🏈 - Your football teams
- **`user_profiles`** 👥 - Player/coach information  
- **`team_members`** 🤝 - Who belongs to which team
- **`playbooks`** 📚 - Collections of plays
- **`plays`** 🎯 - Individual football plays
- **`practice_scripts`** 📝 - Organized practice plans
- **`team_posts`** 💬 - Team communication
- **`super_admins`** 👑 - That's you!

### **How They Connect:**
```
Teams → Have Many → Users (via team_members)
Teams → Have Many → Playbooks  
Playbooks → Have Many → Plays
Teams → Have Many → Practice Scripts
Teams → Have Many → Social Posts
```

## 💡 **SQL Learning Tips**

### **🎯 Remember:**
- **SQL reads like English** - "SELECT name FROM teams WHERE..."
- **Start simple** - Single table queries first
- **Build complexity** - Add JOINs when comfortable
- **Practice daily** - Even 10 minutes helps
- **Use examples** - Copy and modify our queries

### **🔍 When Stuck:**
1. **Check the error message** - They're usually helpful
2. **Use LIMIT 5** - Test with small result sets
3. **Comment out parts** - Isolate the problem
4. **Ask specific questions** - "This query does X but I want Y"

### **🚀 Common Patterns:**
```sql
-- Get data: 
SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition;

-- Count things:
SELECT column, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY column;

-- Connect tables:
SELECT a.name, b.info FROM table_a a JOIN table_b b ON a.id = b.a_id;

-- Your team data:
SELECT * FROM teams WHERE created_by = auth.uid();
```
